<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Recent advances in manufacturing industry has paved way for a systematical deployment of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), within which information from all related perspectives is closely monitored and synchronized between the physical factory floor and the cyber computational space. Moreover, by utilizing advanced information analytics, networked machines will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently. Such trend is transforming manufacturing industry to the next generation, namely Industry 4.0. At this early development phase, there is an urgent need for a clear definition of CPS.

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper explores a method to assess assets performance and predict the remaining useful life, which would lead to proactive maintenance processes to minimize downtime of machinery and production in various industries, thus increasing efficiency of operations and manufacturing. At first, a performance model is established by taking advantage of logistic regression analysis with maximum-likelihood technique. Two kinds of application situations, with or without enough historical data, are discussed in detail. Then, real-time performance is evaluated by inputting features of online data to the logistic model. Finally, the remaining life is estimated using an ARMA model based on machine performance history; degradation predictions are also upgraded dynamically. The results such as current machine running condition and the remaining useful life, are output to the maintenance decision module to determine a window of appropriate maintenance before the machine fails. An application of the method on an elevator door motion system is demonstrated.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Chen, Z., Gryllias, K., &amp; Li, W.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In the era of the so called 4th industrial revolution, the Factory of the Future and the Industrial Internet of Things, the industrial mechanical systems become continuously more intelligent and more complex. Therefore, there is a clear need for research and development on data driven methodologies and condition monitoring techniques which are able to achieve fast, reliable and high-quality diagnosis in an automatic manner. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis approach integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed, consisting of three main stages. Firstly, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is employed in order to obtain pre-processed representations of raw vibration signals. Secondly, a CNN with a square pooling architecture is constructed to extract high-level features. The model does not require extra training and fine-tuning, which can effectively reduce computational cost. Finally, ELM as a strong classifier is further utilized to improve the classification performance on the diagnosis framework. Two datasets, including a gearbox dataset and a motor bearing dataset, have been collected and used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. A comprehensive comparison and analysis with widely used algorithms is also performed. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect different fault types and outperforms other methods in terms of classification accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Bearing fault diagnosis has made some achievements based on massive labeled fault data. In practical engineering, machines are mostly in healthy and faults seldom happen, it s difficult or expensive to collect massive labeled fault data. To solve the problem, an adaptive deep transfer learning method for bearing fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a long-short term memory recurrent neural network model based on instance-transfer learning is constructed to generate some auxiliary datasets. Secondly, joint distribution adaptation, a feature-transfer learning method, which is used to reduce the differences in probability distributions between an auxiliary dataset and target domain dataset. Finally, grey wolf optimization algorithm is introduced to adaptively learn key parameters of joint distribution adaptation. The proposed method is verified with two kinds of datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method when the labeled fault data are scarce.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The proposed approach incorporates sensor fusion by taking advantage of the CNN structure to achieve higher and more robust diagnosis accuracy. Both temporal and spatial information of the raw data from multiple sensors is considered during the training process of the CNN. Representative features can be extracted automatically from the raw signals. It avoids manual feature extraction or selection, which relies heavily on prior knowledge of specific machinery and fault types. The effectiveness of the developed method is evaluated by using datasets from two types of typical rotating machinery, roller bearings, and gearboxes. Compared with traditional approaches using manual feature extraction, the results show the superior diagnosis performance of the proposed method. The present approach can be extended to fault diagnosis of other machinery with various types of sensors due to its end to end feature learning capability.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Fault diagnosis is critical to ensure the safety and reliable operation of rotating machinery. Most methods used in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery extract a few feature values from vibration signals for fault diagnosis, which is a dimensionality reduction from the original signal and may omit some important fault messages in the original signal. Thus, a novel diagnosis method is proposed involving the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly classify the continuous wavelet transform scalogram (CWTS), which is a time-frequency domain transform of the original signal and can contain most of the information of the vibration signals. In this method, CWTS is formed by discomposing vibration signals of rotating machinery in different scales using wavelet transform. Then the CNN is trained to diagnose faults, with CWTS as the input. A series of experiments is conducted on the rotor experiment platform using this method. The results indicate that the proposed method can diagnose the faults accurately. To verify the universality of this method, the trained CNN was also used to perform fault diagnosis for another piece of rotor equipment, and a good result was achieved.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Time-series data is widely adopted in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines as well as other energy systems, where long-term dependency is essential to form the classifiable features. To address the issues that the traditional approaches either rely on expert knowledge and handcrafted features or do not fully model long-term dependencies hidden in time-domain signals, this work presents a novel fault diagnosis framework based on an end-to-end Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, to learn features directly from multivariate time-series data and capture long-term dependencies through recurrent behaviour and gates mechanism of LSTM. Experimental results on two wind turbine datasets show that our method is able to do fault classification effectively from raw time-series signals collected by single or multiple sensors and outperforms state-of-art approaches. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed framework is validated through the experiments on small dataset with limited data.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is crucial for stable, reliable, and safe operation of industrial equipment. In recent years, deep learning models have been widely used in data-driven FDD methods because of their automatic feature learning capability. In general, these models are trained on historical sensor data, and therefore, it is very difficult to meet the real-time requirement of online FDD applications. Since transfer learning can solve different but similar problems in the target domain efficiently and effectively with the knowledge learned from the source domain, this paper proposes an online fault diagnosis method based on a deep transfer convolutional neural network (TCNN) framework. The TCNN framework is made up of an online CNN based on LeNet-5 and several offline CNNs with a shallow structure. First, time-domain signal data are converted into images that contain abundant fault information and are suitable as the input of CNN. Then, the online CNN is constructed to automatically extract representative features from the converted images and classify faults. Finally, in order to improve the real-time performance of the online CNN, several offline CNNs are also constructed and pretrained on related data sets. By directly transferring the shallow layers of the trained offline CNNs to the online CNN, the online CNN can significantly improve the real-time performance and successfully address the issue of achieving the desired diagnostic accuracy within limited training time. The proposed method is validated on two bearing data sets and one pump data set, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method using three data sets are 99.88%, 99.13%, and 99.98%, respectively. The experimental results also indicate that the improvement of accuracy is 19.21% for the motor bearing case, 29.82% for the rolling mill bearing case, and 33.26% for the pump case during the early stage of learning.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper proposes a novel intelligent fault diagnosis method to automatically identify different health conditions of wind turbine (WT) gearbox. Unlike traditional approaches where feature extraction and classification are separately designed and performed, this study aims to automatically learn effective fault features directly from raw vibration signals while classify the type of faults in a single framework, thus providing an end-to-end learning based fault diagnosis system for WT gearbox without additional signal processing and diagnostic expertise. Considering the multiscale characteristics inherent in vibration signals of a gearbox, a new multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) architecture is proposed to perform multiscale feature extraction and classification simultaneously. The proposed MSCNN incorporates multiscale learning into the traditional CNN architecture, which has two merits: (1) high-level fault features can be effectively learned by the hierarchical learning structure with multiple pairs of convolutional and pooling layers and (2) multiscale learning scheme can capture complementary and rich diagnosis information at different scales. This greatly improves the feature learning ability and enables better diagnosis performance. The proposed MSCNN approach is evaluated through experiments on a WT gearbox test rig. Experimental results and comprehensive comparison analysis with respect to the traditional CNN and traditional multiscale feature extractors have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Traditional feature extraction methods are used to extract the features of signal to construct the fault feature matrix, which exists the complex structure, higher correlation, and redundancy. This will increase the complex fault classification and seriously affect the accuracy and efficiency of fault identification. In order to solve these problems, a new fault diagnosis (PABSFD) method based on the principal component analysis (PCA) and the broad learning system (BLS) is proposed for rotor system in this paper. In the proposed PABSFD method, the PCA with revealing the signal essence is used to reduce the dimension of the constructed feature matrix and decrease the linear feature correlation between data and eliminate the redundant attributes in order to obtain the low-dimensional feature matrix with retaining the essential features for the classification model. Then, the BLS with low time complexity and high classification accuracy is regarded as a classification model to realize the fault identification; it can efficiently accomplish the fault classification of rotor system. Finally, the actual vibration data of rotor system are selected to test and verify the effectiveness of the PABSFD method. The experimental results show that the PCA method can effectively eliminate the feature correlation and realize the dimension reduction of the feature matrix, the BLS can take on better adaptability, faster computation speed, and higher classification accuracy, and the PABSFD method can efficiently and accurately obtain the fault diagnosis results.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Deep learning can be applied to the field of fault diagnosis for its powerful feature representation capabilities. When a certain class fault samples available are very limited, it is inevitably to be unbalanced. The fault feature extracted from unbalanced data via deep learning is inaccurate, which can lead to high misclassification rate. To solve this problem, new generator and discriminator of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are designed in this paper to generate more discriminant fault samples using a scheme of global optimization. The generator is designed to generate those fault feature extracted from a few fault samples via Auto Encoder (AE) instead of fault data sample. The training of the generator is guided by fault feature and fault diagnosis error instead of the statistical coincidence of traditional GAN. The discriminator is designed to filter the unqualified generated samples in the sense that qualified samples are helpful for more accurate fault diagnosis. The experimental results of rolling bearings verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Much research has been conducted in prognostics and health management (PHM), an emerging field in mechanical engineering that is gaining interest from both academia and industry. Most of these efforts have been in the area of machinery PHM, resulting in the development of many algorithms for this particular application. The majority of these algorithms concentrate on applications involving common rotary machinery components, such as bearings and gears. Knowledge of this prior work is a necessity for any future research efforts to be conducted; however, there has not been a comprehensive overview that details previous and on-going efforts in PHM. In addition, a systematic method for developing and deploying a PHM system has yet to be established. Such a method would enable rapid customization and integration of PHM systems for diverse applications. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the PHM field, followed by an introduction of a systematic PHM design methodology, 5S methodology, for converting data to prognostics information. This methodology includes procedures for identifying critical components, as well as tools for selecting the most appropriate algorithms for specific applications. Visualization tools are presented for displaying prognostics information in an appropriate fashion for quick and accurate decision making. Industrial case studies are included in this paper to show how this methodology can help in the design of an effective PHM system.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Traditionally, system prognostics and health management (PHM) depends on sufficient prior knowledge of critical components degradation process in order to predict the remaining useful life (RUL). However, the accurate physical or expert models are not available in most cases. This paper proposes a new data-driven approach for prognostics using deep convolution neural networks (DCNN). Time window approach is employed for sample preparation in order for better feature extraction by DCNN. Raw collected data with normalization are directly used as inputs to the proposed network, and no prior expertise on prognostics and signal processing is required, that facilitates the application of the proposed method. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments on the popular C-MAPSS dataset for aero-engine unit prognostics are carried out. High prognostic accuracy on the RUL estimation is achieved. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparisons with other popular approaches and the state-of-the-art results on the same dataset. The results of this study suggest that the proposed data-driven prognostic method offers a new and promising approach.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Accurate evaluation of machine degradation during long-time operation is of great importance.

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Bearing remaining useful life (RUL) prediction plays a crucial role in guaranteeing safe operation of machinery and reducing maintenance loss. In this paper, we present a new deep feature learning method for RUL estimation approach through time frequency representation (TFR) and multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN). TFR can reveal nonstationary property of a bearing degradation signal effectively. After acquiring time-series degradation signals, we get TFRs, which contain plenty of useful information using wavelet transform. Owing to high dimensionality, the size of these TFRs is reduced by bilinear interpolation, which are further regarded as inputs for deep learning models. Here, we introduce an MSCNN model structure, which keeps the global and local information synchronously compared to a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). The salient features, which contribute for RUL estimation, can be learned automatically by MSCNN. The effectiveness of the presented method is validated by the experiment data. Compared to traditional data-driven and different CNN-based feature extraction methods, the proposed method shows enhanced performance in the prediction accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a component or a system is defined as the length from the current time to the end of the useful life. Accurate RUL estimation plays a critical role in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). Data driven approaches for RUL estimation use sensor data and operational data to estimate RUL. Traditional regression-based approaches and recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach use features created from sliding windows to build models. However, sequence information is not fully considered in these approaches. Sequence learning models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have flaws when modeling sequence information. HMMs  are limited to discrete hidden states and are known to have issues when modeling long-term dependencies in the data. RNNs also have issues with long-term dependencies. In this work, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach for RUL estimation, which can make full use of the sensor sequence information and expose hidden patterns within sensor data with multiple operating conditions, fault and degradation models. Extensive experiments using three widely adopted Prognostics and Health Management data sets show that LSTM for RUL estimation significantly outperforms traditional approaches for RUL estimation as well as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Rolling-element bearing is one of the main parts of rotating equipment. In order to avoid the mechanical equipment damage caused by the sudden failure of rolling-element bearings, it is necessary to monitor the condition of bearing and predict its life. Therefore, a two-stage prediction method based on extreme learning machine is proposed to predict the remaining useful life of rolling-element bearings quickly and accurately. This method uses the relative root mean square value (RRMS) to divide the operation stage of the bearing into two stages: normal operation and degradation. Starting from the normal operation stage, according to the principle of univariate prediction, a feedback extreme learning machine model is constructed for real-time short-term prediction of bearing degradation trend. Once the predicted value shows that the bearing has entered the degradation stage, the sensitive features are selected as the input by correlation analysis, and the multi variable feedback extreme learning machine model, which takes into account the dual advantages of multivariable regression and small sample prediction, is constructed to predict the remaining useful life. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher short-term prediction accuracy and faster operation speed in the case of limited learning sample size.</p>

    <title>Remaining useful life predictions for turbofan engine degradation using semi-supervised deep architecture</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In recent years, research has proposed several deep learning (DL) approaches to providing reliable remaining useful life (RUL) predictions in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) applications. Although supervised DL techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory, have outperformed traditional prognosis algorithms, they are still dependent on large labeled training datasets. With respect to real-life PHM applications, high-quality labeled training data might be both challenging and time-consuming to acquire. Alternatively, unsupervised DL techniques introduce an initial pre-training stage to extract degradation related features from raw unlabeled training data automatically. Thus, the combination of unsupervised and supervised (semi-supervised) learning has the potential to provide high RUL prediction accuracy even with reduced amounts of labeled training data. This paper investigates the effect of unsupervised pre-training in RUL predictions utilizing a semi-supervised setup. Additionally, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach is applied in order to tune the diverse amount of hyper-parameters in the training procedure. The advantages of the proposed semi-supervised setup have been verified on the popular C-MAPSS dataset. The experimental study, compares this approach to purely supervised training, both when the training data is completely labeled and when the labeled training data is reduced, and to the most robust results in the literature. The results suggest that unsupervised pre-training is a promising feature in RUL predictions subjected to multiple operating conditions and fault modes.</p>

    <title>Recurrent convolutional neural network A new framework for remaining useful life prediction of machinery</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Deep learning is becoming more appealing in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of machines, because it is able to automatically build the mapping relationship between the raw data and the corresponding RUL by representation learning. Among deep learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are gaining special attention because of its powerful ability in dealing with time-series signals, and have achieved promising results in current studies. These studies, however, suffer from the two limitations: (1) The temporal dependencies of different degradation states are not considered during network construction; and (2) The uncertainty of RUL prediction results cannot be obtained. To overcome the above-mentioned limitations, a new framework named recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) is proposed in this paper for RUL prediction of machinery. In RCNN, recurrent convolutional layers are first constructed to model the temporal dependencies of different degradation states. Then, variational inference is used to quantify the uncertainty of RCNN in RUL prediction. The proposed RCNN is evaluated using vibration data from accelerated degradation tests of rolling element bearings and sensor data from life testing of milling cutters, and compared with some state-of-the-art prognostics approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of RCNN in improving the accuracy and convergence of RUL prediction. More importantly, RCNN is able to provide a probabilistic RUL prediction result, which breaks the inherent limitation of CNNs and facilitates maintenance decision making.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Yue Wang, David G. Infield, Bruce Stephen and Stuart J. Galloway</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Power curve measurements provide a conventional and effective means of assessing the performance of a wind turbine,both commercially and technically. Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issuesmake it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate windspeed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systemrecords, however, often contain significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence ofwind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. Using such raw datafor wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates, which would make the actualfault detection unreliable and would potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paperproposes a probabilistic method for excluding outliers, developed around a copula-based joint probability model. Thisapproach has the capability of capturing the complex non-linear multivariate relationship between parameters, based on theirunivariate marginal distributions; through the use of a copula, data points that deviate significantly from the consolidatedpower curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After filtering the data in thismanner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retainingthe dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effectivein the reliable detection of faults.<br><strong>Keywords</strong>：wind turbine; power curve; outlier rejection; SCADA; copula model</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Data cleaning is a key step in data preprocessing for state assessment of power equipment to help improve data quality and utilization. As the device status information can be made equivalent to the multivariate time sequence of each state, an iterative data cleaning method based on time sequence analysis is proposed. First, the abnormal data in time sequence is classified with the missing values treated as one of the types of the anomalies. Then the impact of different types of anomalies on the sequential model is quantified and several implementation steps of the iterative method are described. Finally, the approach is tested on the on-line monitoring data of a power equipment of the China Southern power grid. The results show that this method is capable of not only effectively identifying the abnormal data, but also repairing the noise points and missing values in meeting the data cleaning requirement.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consist of a large number of sensor nodes which are limited in battery power and communication range and are having multi-modal sensing capability. One of the most significant applications of wireless sensor network is environment monitoring. In this paper, a multi-sensor data fusion algorithm in WSN using fuzzy logic for event detection application is proposed. In the proposed method, each sensor node is equipped with diverse sensors (temperature, humidity light, and Carbon Monoxide). The use of more than one sensor provides additional information on the environmental condition. The processing and fusion of these diverse sensor signals are carried out using proposed fuzzy rule based system. All the diverse sensor signals are collected at the cluster head and fused using fuzzy rule based method. The multiple data fusion process improves the reliability and accuracy of the sensed information and thereby minimizes the false alarm rate.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Data Fusion in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can improve the performance of a network by eliminating redundancy and power consumption, ensuring fault-tolerance between sensors, and managing effectively the available communication bandwidth between network components. In this paper, we develop a data fusion algorithm that combines the cluster-based design of WSNs using fuzzy logic methods. Our results show that the algorithm eliminates redundant sensor reports.  </p>

    <title>Using fuzzy logic for robust event detection in wireless sensor networks</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Event detection is a central component in numerous wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. Nevertheless, the area of event description has not received enough attention. The majority of current event description and detection approaches rely on using precise values to specify event thresholds. However, we believe that crisp values cannot adequately handle the often-imprecise sensor readings. In this paper we demonstrate that using fuzzy values instead of crisp ones significantly improves the accuracy of event detection. We also show that our fuzzy logic approach provides higher event detection accuracy than two well-established classification algorithms. A disadvantage of using fuzzy logic is the exponentially growing size of the fuzzy logic rule-base. As sensor nodes have limited memory, storing large rule-bases could be a challenge. To address this issue, we have developed a number of techniques that help reduce the size of the rule-base by more than 70%, while preserving the event detection accuracy. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>An accurate and fast method for fault diagnosis is an important issue most techniques have sought to. For this reason, a fast fault diagnosis method based on Walsh transform and rough sets is proposed in this paper. Firstly, fault signals are fast transformed by Walsh matrix, and the Walsh spectrums are obtained, whose statistical characteristics constitute feature vectors. Secondly, the feature vectors are discretized and reduced by the rough sets theory, as a result, key features are retained and diagnosis rules are provided. Finally, utilized these diagnosis rules, fault diagnosis is carried out experimentally in the spectrum domain and its performance is compared with that of other methods, the higher accuracy is achieved and much time is saved, which fully validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

    <title>Pipe system diagnosis and leak detection by unsteady-state tests. 1. Harmonic analysis</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：MarcoFerrante，BrunoBrunone</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Since leak reduction actually corresponds to the acquirement of new water quality resources, development of leak detection methodologies is a non-trivial scientific and engineering issue for the water resources community. In this paper and in the companion paper it is shown that unsteady-state tests can be used to pipe diagnosis and leak detection. Specifically, in this part the governing equations for transient flow in pressurized pipes are solved directly in the frequency domain by means of the impulse response method. The analytical expression of the piezometric head spectrum at the downstream end section of a single pipe system during transients is then derived. Within this approach it is shown that the piezometric head spectrum is the product of two terms: the former related only to the maneuver characteristics, the latter depending only on the characteristics of the system. In the case of fast linear closure maneuvers, the analytical expression of both terms is also given. The derived analytical solution of the pressure signal in the frequency domain, allow us to interpret the data acquired in a single pipe system to have information on its state. Experimental data are compared to the analytic solution.  </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Ferrante, M., &amp; Brunone, B</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>As shown in Part 1, the analysis of a pressure signal in the frequency domain can give items of information for leak detection even though, moving from time to frequency domain, interesting information about the arrival time of pressure waves are lost. To overcome this limitation and to widen the applicability of transient-test based methodologies for leak detection, the wavelet transform of laboratory experimental data is used. Such data consist of pressure time histories acquired at one measurement section during transients in a single pipe system. The wavelet transform is used to detect local singularities in the pressure time history due to the presence of a leak. The discontinuity occurrence in time reveals the arrival time of the leak reflected pressure wave and is the basis for leak location.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The term smart manufacturing refers to a future-state of manufacturing, where the real-time transmission and analysis of data from across the factory creates manufacturing intelligence, which can be used to have a positive impact across all aspects of operations. In recent years, many initiatives and groups have been formed to advance smart manufacturing, with the most prominent being the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC), Industry 4.0, and the Industrial Internet Consortium. These initiatives comprise industry, academic and government partners, and contribute to the development of strategic policies, guidelines, and roadmaps relating to smart manufacturing adoption. In turn, many of these recommendations may be implemented using data-centric technologies, such as Big Data, Machine Learning, Simulation, Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems, to realize smart operations in the factory. Given the importance of machine uptime and availability in smart manufacturing, this research centers on the application of data-driven analytics to industrial equipment maintenance. The main contributions of this research are a set of data and system requirements for implementing equipment maintenance applications in industrial environments, and an information system model that provides a scalable and fault tolerant big data pipeline for integrating, processing and analyzing industrial equipment data. These contributions are considered in the context of highly regulated large-scale manufacturing environments, where legacy (e.g. automation controllers) and emerging instrumentation (e.g. internet-aware smart sensors) must be supported to facilitate initial smart manufacturing efforts. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper presents the use of accelerometer signals in order to detect cutter tool wear and tool fault under different cutting conditions. The new method, Hilbert Huang transform (HHT), was applied to the cutter tool wear and tool fault monitoring and compared to Fourier transform. In the results processed by short-time Fourier transform the cutter tool wear or tool fault is detected by increasing the power in the power spectral density. The acceleration signals (processed by using HHT) change the frequency in the marginal spectra as a result of geometric change of the cutter tool. Results are presented in both frequency domain and time frequency domain in the case of HHT. The HHT presents data locally without harmonics. This fact permits overcoming of the nonlinearity and nonstationarity of the acceleration signal. Axes x and z are the most sensitive to both HHT and Fourier transform.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Nickel-based superalloys are widely used in the aircraft industry since they are exceptionally thermal resistant, retaining their mechanical properties at temperatures of up to 700 C. On the other hand, since they are very difficult to machine, tool life is typically short and can finish abruptly. As catastrophic tool failure can destroy an expensive workpiece, automatic tool condition monitoring (TCM) has become particularly critical. This paper presents an application of the wavelet packet transform (WPT) for extracting useful TCM features from the cutting forces and acoustic emission (AE) signals during rough turning of Inconel 625. New, improved methods of signal feature (SF) relevancy evaluation were proposed based on determination and correlation coefficients. Out of several SFs calculated from bandpass signals, the most useful for TCM were automatically selected. The selected features were used for tool condition monitoring.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Prognostic of machine health estimates the remaining useful life of machine components. It deals with prediction of machine health condition based on past measured data from condition monitoring (CM). It has benefits to reduce the production downtime, spare-parts inventory, maintenance cost, and safety hazards. Many papers have reported the valuable models and methods of prognostics systems. However, it was rarely found the papers deal with censored data, which is common in machine condition monitoring practice. This work concerns with developing intelligent machine prognostics system using survival analysis and support vector machine (SVM). SA utilizes censored and uncensored data collected from CM routine and then estimates the survival probability of failure time of machine components. SVM is trained by data input from CM histories data that corresponds to target vectors of estimated survival probability. After validation process, SVM is employed to predict failure time of individual unit of machine component. Simulation and experimental bearing degradation data are employed to validate the proposed method. The result shows that the proposed method is promising to be a probability-based machine prognostics system.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>For there are too many drawbacks like excessive input variables, high computational complexity and low efficiency in evaluation methods of missing data for wireless sensor network, A Multiple-Regression evaluation method based on correlation analysis was proposed in this paper. First, the sensor data of the wireless sensor networks was correlatively analyzed, and most correlation sensor data was explored. Then the sensor data was used as input of the multiple linear Regression model and evaluation method. In the experimental stage, the sensor temperature data of actual wireless sensor network has been used to test this method. Experiment results show that the scheme is efficient with low prediction error, thus it owns practical value and can be used to evaluate the missing data in wireless sensor networks.</p>

    <title>On-line fan blade damage detection using neural networks</title>
    <url>/2006/07/19/24.On-line%20fan%20blade%20damage%20detection%20using%20neural%20networks/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Oberholster, A. J., &amp; Heyns, P. S.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper presents a methodology for monitoring the on-line condition of axial-flow fan blades with the use of neural networks. In developing this methodology, the first stage was to utilise neural networks trained on features extracted from on-line blade vibration signals measured on an experimental test structure. Results from a stationary experimental modal analysis of the structure were used for identifying global blade mode shapes and their corresponding frequencies. These in turn were used to assist in identifying vibration-related features suitable for neural network training. The features were extracted from on-line blade vibration and strain signals which were measured using a number of sensors. The second stage in the development of the methodology entails utilising neural networks trained on numerical Frequency Response Function (FRF) features obtained from a Finite Element Model (FEM) of the test structure. Frequency domain features obtained from on-line experimental measurements were used to normalise the numerical FRF features prior to neural network training. Following training, the networks were tested using experimental frequency domain features. This approach makes it unnecessary to damage the structure in order to train the neural networks. The paper shows that it is possible to classify damage for several fan blades by using neural networks with on-line vibration measurements from sensors not necessarily installed on the damaged blades themselves. The significance of this is that it proves the possibility to perform on-line fan blade damage classification using less than one sensor per blade. Even more significant is the demonstration that an on-line damage detection system for a fan can be developed without having to damage the actual structure.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In this paper a fault diagnosis technique, which employs neural networks to analyze signatures of analog circuits, is proposed. Radial basis functions networks (RBFN) are used to process circuit input output measurements, and to perform soft fault location. Both noise and effect of parameter variations in the tolerance ranges of non-faulty components are taken into account. The network is trained with circuit signatures, obtained by measuring and coding both circuit input and output signals, which are contained in a fault dictionary . In this context RBFN architecture is selected, because it is able to cope with new fault conditions not well represented in the fault dictionary used for network training. The RBFN classifier was applied to linear and non-linear sample circuits, considering faults both at sub-system level and at component level. Simulations and experimental results show that the developed nets succeeded in classifying faults. The nets trained with single faults has in many cases detected also multiple faults.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Railways are expected to operate with ever increasing levels of availability, reliability, safety and security. One way of ensuring high levels of dependability is through the use of condition monitoring systems. This paper presents the results of research on fault detection and diagnosis methods for railway track circuits. The proposed method uses a hybrid quantitative/qualitative technique known as a neuro-fuzzy system. Such a hybrid fault detection and diagnosis system combine the benefits of both fuzzy logic and neural networks, i.e. the ability to deal with system imprecision and to learn by neural network training processes. It is shown that the proposed method correctly detects and diagnoses the most commonly occurring track circuit failures in a laboratory test rig of one type of audio frequency jointless track circuit. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Tamilselvan, P., &amp; Wang, P.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Effective health diagnosis provides multifarious benefits such as improved safety, improved reliability and reduced costs for operation and maintenance of complex engineered systems. This paper presents a novel multi-sensor health diagnosis method using deep belief network (DBN). DBN has recently become a popular approach in machine learning for its promised advantages such as fast inference and the ability to encode richer and higher order network structures. The DBN employs a hierarchical structure with multiple stacked restricted Boltzmann machines and works through a layer by layer successive learning process. The proposed multi-sensor health diagnosis methodology using DBN based state classification can be structured in three consecutive stages: first, defining health states and preprocessing sensory data for DBN training and testing; second, developing DBN based classification models for diagnosis of predefined health states; third, validating DBN classification models with testing sensory dataset. Health diagnosis using DBN based health state classification technique is compared with four existing diagnosis techniques. Benchmark classification problems and two engineering health diagnosis applications: aircraft engine health diagnosis and electric power transformer health diagnosis are employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. </p>

    <title>An approach to fault diagnosis of reciprocating compressor valves using Teager–Kaiser energy operator and deep belief networks</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper presents an approach to implement vibration, pressure, and current signals for fault diagnosis of the valves in reciprocating compressors. Due to the complexity of structure and motion of such compressor, the acquired vibration signal normally involves transient impacts and noise. This causes the useful information to be corrupted and difficulty in accurately diagnosing the faults with traditional methods. To reveal the fault patterns contained in this signal, the Teager Kaiser energy operation (TKEO) is proposed to estimate the amplitude envelopes. In case of pressure and current, the random noise is removed by using a denoising method based on wavelet transform. Subsequently, statistical measures are extracted from all signals to represent the characteristics of the valve conditions. In order to classify the faults of compressor valves, a new type of learning architecture for deep generative model called deep belief networks (DBNs) is applied. DBN employs a hierarchical structure with multiple stacked restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and works through a greedy layer-by-layer learning algorithm. In pattern recognition research areas, DBN has proved to be very effective and provided with high performance for binary values. However, for implementing DBN to fault diagnosis where most of signals are real-valued, RBM with Bernoulli hidden units and Gaussian visible units is considered in this study. The proposed approach is validated with the signals from a two-stage reciprocating air compressor under different valve conditions. To confirm the superiority of DBN in fault classification, its performance is compared with that of relevant vector machine and back propagation neuron networks. The achieved accuracy indicates that the proposed approach is highly reliable and applicable in fault diagnosis of industrial reciprocating machinery. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Condition-based maintenance (CBM) and prognostics and health management (PHM) have emerged over recent years as significant technologies that are making an impact on both military and commercial maintenance practices. We are indeed witnessing a true paradigm shift in the way complex dynamic systems (aircraft and spacecraft, shipboard systems, industrial and manufacturing processes, etc.) are designed, monitored, and maintained. Fault diagnosis and prognosis of the failing component s remaining useful life, as well as logistics support activities required to maintain, repair, or overhaul such critical systems, require active contribution from multiple disciplines. CBM and PHM technologies are characterized by the merging and strong coupling of interdisciplinary trends from the engineering sciences, computer science, reliability engineering, communications, management, etc. Writing a book that is not merely an edited collection of technical papers in this area but presents systematically and as thoroughly as possible the diverse subject matter from sensors and systems studies to logistics therefore is a challenging and arduous task that requires the contributions of many experts and the compilation of source and reference material across disciplines.</p>

    <title>Bearing fault diagnosis method based on Hilbert envelope spectrum and deep belief network</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>When fault occurs in bearing, the frequency spectrum of vibration signal would change and it contains a considerable amount of fault information which can reflect the actual work condition and the fault type of bearing. Recently, the statistical features of the frequency spectrum have been widely used in bearing fault diagnosis. However, there are lots of statistical features with different sensitivity to fault identification. Selecting the most sensible statistical features for improving classification accuracy is often determined with experience, which will make great subjective influence on the fault diagnosis results. Deep belief network (DBN) is a deep neural network which can automatically find a latent hierarchical feature representation from the high dimension input data. In this study, a bearing fault diagnosis method based on Hilbert envelope spectrum and DBN is proposed. Firstly, the vibration signals under different test conditions are resampled. Secondly, the whole Hilbert envelope spectrum of the resampled signal is used directly as eigenvector to characterize the fault type of bearing. Finally, a DBN classifier model is established to recognize the fault type of bearing. DBN classifier model can be used as both an automatic feature extractor and a classifier for bearing fault diagnosis. Therefore, the process of fault diagnosis can be greatly simplified. The results of two different experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the competing methods and it can obtain a more excellent diagnostic performance. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Identifying gearbox damage categories, especially for early faults and combined faults, is a challenging task in gearbox fault diagnosis. This paper presents multiple classifiers based on multi-layer neural networks (MLNN) to implement vibration signals for fault diagnosis in gearbox. A MLNN-based learning architecture using deep belief network (MLNNDBN) is proposed for gearbox fault diagnosis. Training process of the proposed learning architecture includes two stages: A deep belief network is constructed firstly, and then is trained; after a certain amount of epochs, the weights of deep belief network are used to initialize the weights of the constructed MLNN; at last, the trained MLNN is used as classifiers to classify gearbox faults. Multidimensional feature sets including time-domain, frequency-domain features are extracted to reveal gear health conditions. Experiments with different combined faults were conducted, and the vibration signals were captured under different loads and motor speeds. To confirm the superiority of MLNNDBN in fault classification, its performance is compared with other MLNN-based methods with different fine-tuning schemes and relevant vector machine. The achieved accuracy indicates that the proposed approach is highly reliable and applicable in fault diagnosis of industrial reciprocating machinery. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Gearboxes are crucial transmission components in mechanical systems. Fault diagnosis is an important tool to maintain gearboxes in healthy conditions. It is challenging to recognize fault existences and, if any, failure patterns in such transmission elements due to their complicated configurations. This paper addresses a multimodal deep support vector classification (MDSVC) approach, which employs separation–fusion based deep learning in order to perform fault diagnosis tasks for gearboxes. Considering that different modalities can be made to describe same object, multimodal homologous features of the gearbox vibration measurements are first separated in time, frequency and wavelet modalities, respectively. A Gaussian-Bernoulli deep Boltzmann machine (GDBM) without final output is subsequently suggested to learn pattern representations for features in each modality. A support vector classifier is finally applied to fuse GDBMs in different modalities towards the construction of the MDSVC model. With the present model, “deep” representations from “wide” modalities improve fault diagnosis capabilities. Fault diagnosis experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed method on both spur and helical gearboxes. The proposed model achieves the best fault classification rate in experiments when compared to representative deep and shallow learning methods. Results indicate that the proposed separation–fusion based deep learning strategy is effective for the gearbox fault diagnosis.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The vibration signals measured from a rolling bearing are usually affected by the variable operating conditions and background noise which lead to the diversity and complexity of the vibration signal characteristics, and it is a challenge to effectively identify the rolling bearing faults from such vibration signals with no further fault information. In this paper, a novel optimization deep belief network (DBN) is proposed for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Stochastic gradient descent is used to efficiently fine-tune all the connection weights after the pre-training of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) based on the energy functions, and the classification accuracy of the DBN is improved. Particle swarm is further used to decide the optimal structure of the trained DBN, and the optimization DBN is designed. The proposed method is applied to analyze the simulation signal and experimental signal of a rolling bearing. The results confirm that the proposed method is more accurate and robust than other intelligent methods.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Since the operating state of the compressor unit could be influenced by several factors including connected pipeline, auxiliary system and other related equipment, it is necessary to treat the compressor unit as a sub-chain of the whole pipeline equipment chain. To deal with the indistinguishable phenomena in the compressor unit, including pipeline leakage, ice jam and auxiliary system failure, an innovative early-warning model based on analyses of characteristics of early-warning system and equipment chain is proposed in this thesis, which fully takes advantage of feature extraction of deep belief network (DNN) and hidden state analysis of hidden Markov model (HMM) to estimate the operating status of the compressor unit. Validated by field data, the model is demonstrated to be of preferable accuracy and generalization for early-warning of the equipment chain by results of experiments. Moreover, it is advantageous in terms of processing speed. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>High-dimensional problem domains pose significant challenges for anomaly detection. The presence of irrelevant features can conceal the presence of anomalies. This problem, known as the curse of dimensionality, is an obstacle for many anomaly detection techniques. Building a robust anomaly detection model for use in high-dimensional spaces requires the combination of an unsupervised feature extractor and an anomaly detector. While one-class support vector machines are effective at producing decision surfaces from well-behaved feature vectors, they can be inefficient at modelling the variation in large, high-dimensional datasets. Architectures such as deep belief networks (DBNs) are a promising technique for learning robust features. We present a hybrid model where an unsupervised DBN is trained to extract generic underlying features, and a one-class SVM is trained from the features learned by the DBN. Since a linear kernel can be substituted for nonlinear ones in our hybrid model without loss of accuracy, our model is scalable and computationally efficient. The experimental results show that our proposed model yields comparable anomaly detection performance with a deep autoencoder, while reducing its training and testing time by a factor of 3 and 1000, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In the rolling bearing fault diagnosis, the vibration signal of single sensor is usually nonstationary and noisy, which contains very little useful information, and impacts the accuracy of fault diagnosis. In order to solve the problem, this paper presents a novel fault diagnosis method using multivibration signals and deep belief network (DBN). By utilizing the DBN’s learning ability, the proposed method can adaptively fuse multifeature data and identify various bearing faults. Firstly, multiple vibration signals are acquainted from various fault bearings. Secondly, some time-domain characteristics are extracted from original signals of each individual sensor. Finally, the features data of all sensors are put into the DBN and generate an appropriate classifier to complete fault diagnosis. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of multivibration signals, experiments are carried out on the individual sensor with the same conditions and procedure. At the same time, the method is compared with SVM, KNN, and BPNN methods. The results show that the DBN-based method is able to not only adaptively fuse multisensor data, but also obtain higher identification accuracy than other methods. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Vibration signals of gearbox are sensitive to the existence of the fault. Based on vibration signals, this paper presents an implementation of deep learning algorithm convolutional neural network (CNN) used for fault identification and classification in gearboxes. Different combinations of condition patterns based on some basic fault conditions are considered. 20 test cases with different combinations of condition patterns are used, where each test case includes 12 combinations of different basic condition patterns. Vibration signals are preprocessed using statistical measures from the time domain signal such as standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In the frequency domain, the spectrum obtained with FFT is divided into multiple bands, and the root mean square (RMS) value is calculated for each one so the energy maintains its shape at the spectrum peaks. The achieved accuracy indicates that the proposed approach is highly reliable and applicable in fault diagnosis of industrial reciprocating machinery. Comparing with peer algorithms, the present method exhibits the best performance in the gearbox fault diagnosis.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Fault diagnosis is important for the maintenance of rotating machinery. The detection of faults and fault patterns is a challenging part of machinery fault diagnosis. To tackle this problem, a model for deep statistical feature learning from vibration measurements of rotating machinery is presented in this paper. Vibration sensor signals collected from rotating mechanical systems are represented in the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains, each of which is then used to produce a statistical feature set. For learning statistical features, real-value Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GRBMs) are stacked to develop a Gaussian-Bernoulli deep Boltzmann machine (GDBM). The suggested approach is applied as a deep statistical feature learning tool for both gearbox and bearing systems. The fault classification performances in experiments using this approach are 95.17% for the gearbox, and 91.75% for the bearing system. The proposed approach is compared to such standard methods as a support vector machine, GRBM and a combination model. In experiments, the best fault classification rate was detected using the proposed model. The results show that deep learning with statistical feature extraction has an essential improvement potential for diagnosing rotating machinery faults.</p>

    <title>Case-based expert system using wavelet packet transform and kernel-based feature manipulation for engine ignition system diagnosis</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><pre><code>Whenever there is any fault in an automotive engine ignition system or changes of an engine condition, an automotive mechanic can conventionally perform an analysis on the ignition pattern of the engine to examine symptoms, based on specific domain knowledge (domain features of an ignition pattern). In this paper, case-based reasoning (CBR) approach is presented to help solve human diagnosis problem using not only the domain features but also the extracted features of signals captured using a computer-linked automotive scope meter. CBR expert system has the advantage that it provides user with multiple possible diagnoses, instead of a single most probable diagnosis provided by traditional network-based classifiers such as multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and support vector machines (SVM). In addition, CBR overcomes the problem of incremental and decremental knowledge update as required by both MLP and SVM. Although CBR is effective, its application for high dimensional domains is inefficient because every instance in a case library must be compared during reasoning. To overcome this inefficiency, a combination of preprocessing methods, such as wavelet packet transforms (WPT), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and kernel K-means (KKM) is proposed. Considering the ignition signals captured by a scope meter are very similar, WPT is used for feature extraction so that the ignition signals can be compared with the extracted features. However, there exist many redundant points in the extracted features, which may degrade the diagnosis performance. Therefore, KPCA is employed to perform a dimension reduction. In addition, the number of cases in a case library can be controlled through clustering; KKM is adopted for this purpose. In this paper, several diagnosis methods are also used for comparison including MLP, SVM and CBR. Experimental results showed that CBR using WPT and KKM generated the highest accuracy and fitted better the requirements of the expert system.

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Vibration signals of gearbox are sensitive to the existence of the fault. Based on vibration signals, this paper presents an implementation of deep learning algorithm convolutional neural network (CNN) used for fault identification and classification in gearboxes. Different combinations of condition patterns based on some basic fault conditions are considered. 20 test cases with different combinations of condition patterns are used, where each test case includes 12 combinations of different basic condition patterns. Vibration signals are preprocessed using statistical measures from the time domain signal such as standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In the frequency domain, the spectrum obtained with FFT is divided into multiple bands, and the root mean square (RMS) value is calculated for each one so the energy maintains its shape at the spectrum peaks. The achieved accuracy indicates that the proposed approach is highly reliable and applicable in fault diagnosis of industrial reciprocating machinery. Comparing with peer algorithms, the present method exhibits the best performance in the gearbox fault diagnosis. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In recent years, more than 300 sets of Trouble of Running Freight Train Detection Systems (TFDSs) have been installed on railway to monitor the safety of running freight trains in China. However, TFDS is simply responsible for capturing, transmitting, and storing images, and fails to recognize faults automatically. Motivated by the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the tasks of image recognition, this paper makes essential use of CNN models and proposes an automatic fault recognition system (AFRS) for recognizing four typical faults in TFDS simultaneously. AFRS is a two-stage system: In the first stage, a coarse-to-fine scheme based on CNN model is adopted to detect the target regions of side frame keys (SFKs) and shaft bolts (SBs) simultaneously. In the second stage, we establish another CNN model for multi-fault determination to recognize four typical faults emerged in the target regions of SFKs and SBs. The experimental results show that this system has an excellent performance of multi-fault recognition in TFDS. High recognition accuracy rates, low false ratios and low omission ratios are obtained for all the four typical faults, demonstrating the high recognition ability and robustness against various low-quality imaging situations.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Traditional artificial methods and intelligence-based methods of classifying and diagnosing various mechanical faults with high accuracy by extracting effective features from vibration data, such as support vector machines and back propagation neural networks, have been widely investigated. However, the problems of extracting features automatically without significantly increasing the demand for machinery expertise and maximizing accuracy without overcomplicating machine structure have to date remained unsolved. Therefore, a novel hierarchical learning rate adaptive deep convolution neural network based on an improved algorithm was proposed in this study, and its use to diagnose bearing faults and determine their severity was investigated. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experiment was conducted with bearing-fault data samples obtained from a test rig. The method achieved a satisfactory performance in terms of both fault-pattern recognition and fault-size evaluation. In addition, comparison revealed that the improved algorithm is well suited to the fault-diagnosis model, and that the proposed method is superior to other existing methods.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Although the orbit analysis (orbit shape and size) is commonly used to diagnose rotating machinery, the diagnosis heavily depends on the expert knowledge or experience due to the difficulties of extracting mathematical features for data-driven approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an autonomous orbit pattern recognition algorithm using the deep learning method on shaft orbit shape images. In details, the convolutional neural network is implemented to construct weights between neurons and to generate the entire structure of the neural network. Then, the created network enables us to classify fault modes of rotating machinery via orbit images. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed framework through a rotating testbed.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The paper deals with the problem of robust fault detection using recurrent neural networks and chaos engineering. The main part of the proposed approach is a locally recurrent neural network that is composed of complex dynamic neural units for which chaotic behaviour can be obtained. Selected global and local optimization methods are connected to have diphase strategies for training this kind of neural networks. And beyond this, chaos engineering is incorporated into both the evolutionary and simulated annealing algorithm in order to improve the efficiency of the tuning procedure. The problem of selecting the most relevant input variables is solved by means of extended Hellwig׳s method of integral capacity of information. Criteria isolines and a sensitive-based method are used to identify the suitable architecture of a neural network. Moreover, the issue of stability analysis of neural models is also considered in this paper. Recurrence quantification analysis is proposed for residual evaluation in order to have the comprehensive methodology of neural model-based fault detection. The preliminary verification of the elaborated methodology in modelling tasks was carried out for both simulation and industrial data. The fundamental verification was conducted for the data made available within DAMADICS benchmark problem. The achieved results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

    <title>Intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearing using hierarchical convolutional network based health state classification</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Lu, C., Wang, Z., &amp; Zhou, B.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Rolling bearing tips are often the most susceptible to electro-mechanical system failure due to high-speed and complex working conditions, and recent studies on diagnosing bearing health using vibration data have developed an assortment of feature extraction and fault classification methods. Due to the strong non-linear and non-stationary characteristics, an effective and reliable deep learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is investigated in this paper making use of cognitive computing theory, which introduces the advantages of image recognition and visual perception to bearing fault diagnosis by simulating the cognition process of the cerebral cortex. The novel feature representation method for bearing data is first discussed using supervised deep learning with the goal of identifying more robust and salient feature representations to reduce information loss. Next, the deep hierarchical structure is trained in a robust manner that is established using a transmitting rule of greedy training layer by layer. Convolution computation, rectified linear units, and sub-sampling are applied for weight replication and reducing the number of parameters that need to be learned to improve the general feed-forward back propagation training. The CNN model could thus reduce learning computation requirements in the temporal dimension, and an invariance level of working condition fluctuation and ambient noise is provided by identifying the elementary features of bearings. A top classifier followed by a back propagation process is used for fault classification. Contrast experiments and analyses have been undertaken to delineate the effectiveness of the CNN model for fault classification of rolling bearings.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>A recurrent fuzzy neural cerebellar model articulation network (RFNCMAN) fault-tolerant control of a six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) position servo drive is proposed in this study. First, the fault detection and operating decision method of the six-phase PMSM position servo drive is developed. Then, an ideal computed torque controller is designed for the tracking of the rotor position reference command. In general, it is impossible to design an ideal computed control law owing to the uncertainties of the six-phase PMSM position servo drive, which are difficult to know in advance for practical applications. Therefore, the RFNCMAN, which combined the merits of a recurrent fuzzy cerebellar model articulation network and a recurrent fuzzy neural network, is proposed to estimate a nonlinear equation included in the ideal computed control law with a robust compensator designed to compensate the minimum reconstructed error. Furthermore, the adaptive learning algorithm for the online training of the RFNCMAN is derived using the Lyapunov stability to guarantee the closed-loop stability. Finally, the proposed RFNCMAN fault-tolerant control system is implemented in a 32- bit floating-point DSP. The effectiveness of the six-phase PMSM position servo drive using the proposed intelligent fault-tolerant control system is verified by some experimental results.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Timely detection and identification of faults in railway track circuits are crucial for the safety and availability of railway networks. In this paper, the use of the long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is proposed to accomplish these tasks based on the commonly available measurement signals. By considering the signals from multiple track circuits in a geographic area, faults are diagnosed from their spatial and temporal dependences. A generative model is used to show that the LSTM network can learn these dependences directly from the data. The network correctly classifies 99.7% of the test input sequences, with no false positive fault detections. In addition, the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method is used to examine the resulting network, further showing that it has learned the relevant dependences in the data. Finally, we compare our LSTM network with a convolutional network trained on the same task. From this comparison, we conclude that the LSTM network architecture is better suited for the railway track circuit fault detection and identification tasks than the convolutional network. </p>

In the proposed method, it is assumed that the diagnosed system can be modelled by the recurrent neural network, which can be transformed into the linear parameter varying form. Such a system description allows developing the designing scheme of the robust unknown input observer within framework for a class of non-linear systems. The proposed approach is designed in such a way that a prescribed disturbance attenuation level is achieved with respect to the actuator fault estimation error, while guaranteeing the convergence of the observer. The application of the robust unknown input observer enables actuator fault estimation, which allows applying the developed approach to the fault tolerant control tasks.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In this paper, a new approach for Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) of gas turbine engines is proposed by developing an ensemble of dynamic neural network identifiers. For health monitoring of the gas turbine engine, its dynamics is first identified by constructing three separate or individual dynamic neural network architectures. Specifically, a dynamic multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a dynamic radial-basis function (RBF) neural network, and a dynamic support vector machine (SVM) are trained to individually identify and represent the gas turbine engine dynamics. Next, three ensemble-based techniques are developed to represent the gas turbine engine dynamics, namely, two heterogeneous ensemble models and one homogeneous ensemble model. It is first shown that all ensemble approaches do significantly improve the overall performance and accuracy of the developed system identification scheme when compared to each of the stand-alone solutions. The best selected stand-alone model (i.e., the dynamic RBF network) and the best selected ensemble architecture (i.e., the heterogeneous ensemble) in terms of their performances in achieving an accurate system identification are then selected for solving the FDI task. The required residual signals are generated by using both a single model-based solution and an ensemble-based solution under various gas turbine engine health conditions. Our extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the fault detection and isolation task achieved by using the residuals that are obtained from the dynamic ensemble scheme results in a significantly more accurate and reliable performance as illustrated through detailed quantitative confusion matrix analysis and comparative studies.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The general problem of identifying the condition of a structure or machine, and in particular its vibration signature, as a means to optimise maintenance costs and reliability is currently of great interest. This work presents a method for predicting the state of damage in the future for prognostic maintenance, rather than just identifying the current state of damage for diagnostic maintenance. Prognostics carries great economic importance because it allows the assessment of the likelihood of failure as a function of future time in terms of past and current conditions. We present an experimental example using the modal response of a notched, tensioned, steel band undergoing broadband vibration excitation to propagate cracks across the notched area until failure. The natural modes of the band are monitored during fatigue and the modal frequency shifts are used as a prognostic observable. A Kalman filter is then used track these modal frequency shifts and predict the likelihood and time when the amount of frequency shift is indicative of imminent failure. As a practical approach for prognostics of the band failure, we examine whether the modal frequencies are converging towards a stable state (such as during the break-in period), or diverging away from a stable state. A new probability density function for the remaining useful life is derived from the kinematic model. This method of using the kinematic state of a damage observable for failure prognostics can be extended to any dynamical system with observable features which correlate with damage or fatigue state.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In conventional fault tree analysis, probabilities of the basic events were treated as precise values; sometimes this probability does not correspond to real situations of systems because of ambiguity and the imprecision of some basic events. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a new fuzzy probabilistic method, based on the fuzzy set theory and the Buckley approach, is used in the fault tree analysis for quantifying the basic event uncertainty. According to failure modes, a fault tree of a milk manufacturing unit is constructed. Failure in the milk manufacturing workshop is analysed using the proposed method.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In this paper, a bank of Kalman filters is applied to aircraft gas turbine engine sensor and actuator fault detection and isolation (FDI) in conjunction with the detection of component faults. This approach uses multiple Kalman filters, each of which is designed for detecting a specific sensor or actuator fault. In the event that a fault does occur, all filters except the one using the correct hypothesis will produce large estimation errors, thereby isolating the specific fault. In the meantime, a set of parameters that indicate engine component performance is estimated for the detection of abrupt degradation. The proposed FDI approach is applied to a nonlinear engine simulation at nominal and aged conditions, and the evaluation results for various engine faults at cruise operating conditions are given. The ability of the proposed approach to reliably detect and isolate sensor and actuator faults is demonstrated.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper presents a model-based fault detection approach for induction motors. A new filtering technique using Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is utilized as a state estimation tool for on-line detection of broken bars in induction motors based on rotor parameter value estimation from stator current and voltage processing. The hypothesis on which the detection is based is that the failure events are detected by jumps in the estimated parameter values of the model. Both UKF and EKF are used to estimate the value of rotor resistance. Upon breaking a bar the estimated rotor resistance is increased instantly, thus providing two values of resistance after and before bar breakage. In order to compare the estimation performance of the EKF and UKF, both observers are designed for the same motor model and run with the same covariance matrices under the same conditions. Computer simulations are carried out for a squirrel cage induction motor. The results show the superiority of UKF over EKF in nonlinear system (such as induction motors) as it provides better estimates for rotor fault detection.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>According to the shortcoming that the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) method can only estimate the speed and rotor position of induction motors in time domain when it is used to diagnose the fault existed in induction motor. A new multi-scale default diagnosing method is developed by combining EKF and wavelet transform. By monitoring the voltages and currents of the stator, it is possible to estimate the speed and position on-line. The new filter combines the merit of EKF and wavelet, and it not only possesses the multiscale analysis capability both in time domain and frequency domain, but also has better estimation accuracy than traditional EKF. Computer simulation shows the effect of the new algorithm.  </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Baruah, P., &amp; Chinnam*, R. B.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Despite considerable advances over the last two decades in sensing instrumentation and information technology infrastructure, monitoring and diagnostics technology has not yet found its place in health management of mainstream machinery and equipment. This is in spite of numerous studies reporting that the expected savings from widespread deployment of condition-based maintenance (CBM) technology would be in the tens of billions of dollars in many industrial sectors as well as in governmental agencies. It turns out that a prerequisite to widespread deployment of CBM technology and practice in industry is cost efficient and effective diagnostics and prognostics. This paper presents a novel method for employing hidden Markov models (HMMs) for carrying out both diagnostic as well as prognostic activities for metal cutting tools. The methods employ HMMs for modelling sensor signals emanating from the machine (or features thereof), and in turn, identify the health state of the cutting tool as well as facilitate estimation of remaining useful life. This paper also investigates some of the underlying issues of proper HMM design and training for the express purpose of effective diagnostics and prognostics. The proposed methods were validated on a physical test-bed, a vertical drilling machine. Experimental results are very promising.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Camci, F., &amp; Chinnam, R. B.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The ability to effectively control maintenance and support costs under ever increasing global competition not only requires timely identification of impending failures of critical equipment but also calls for accurate estimation of remaining-useful-life (RUL). This is especially important for critical systems with high maintenance and logistics cost such as military systems and nuclear plants. Accurately forecasting the failure time (i.e., prognostics) can lead to failure prevention and diminish the time and cost associated with unnecessary maintenance. This paper presents a prognostic method that relies on hidden Markov models (HMMs) for health-state forecasting. HMMs present an opportunity to estimate unobservable health-states using observable sensor signals. In particular, implementation of HMM based models as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) improves the design and realization of flexible HMM structures (such as auto-regressive HMMs and hierarchical HMMs) for representing complex systems. Hierarchical HMMs are employed here to estimate on-line the health-state of drill-bits as they deteriorate with use on a CNC drilling machine. Hierarchical HMM is composed of sub-HMMs in a hierarchical fashion such that health-states can be represented as distinct nodes at the top of the hierarchy. Monte Carlo simulation, with state transition probabilities derived from a hierarchical HMM, is employed for RUL estimation. Results on health-state and RUL estimation are very promising and are reported in this paper.  </p>

    <title>Hidden semi-Markov model based methodology for multi-sensor equipment health diagnosis and prognosis</title>
    <url>/2007/07/19/56.Hidden%20semi-Markov%20model%20based%20methodology%20for%20multi-sensor%20equipment%20health%20diagnosis%20and%20prognosis/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Dong, M., &amp; He, D.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper presents an integrated platform for multi-sensor equipment diagnosis and prognosis. This integrated framework is based on hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). Unlike a state in a standard hidden Markov model (HMM), a state in an HSMM generates a segment of observations, as opposed to a single observation in the HMM. Therefore, HSMM structure has a temporal component compared to HMM. In this framework, states of HSMMs are used to represent the health status of a component. The duration of a health state is modeled by an explicit Gaussian probability function. The model parameters (i.e., initial state distribution, state transition probability matrix, observation probability matrix, and health-state duration probability distribution) are estimated through a modified forward backward training algorithm. The re-estimation formulae for model parameters are derived. The trained HSMMs can be used to diagnose the health status of a component. Through parameter estimation of the health-state duration probability distribution and the proposed backward recursive equations, one can predict the useful remaining life of the component. To determine the value of each sensor information, discriminant function analysis is employed to adjust the weight or importance assigned to a sensor. Therefore, sensor fusion becomes possible in this HSMM based framework. The validation of the proposed framework and methodology are carried out in real world applications: monitoring hydraulic pumps from Caterpillar Inc. The results show that the increase of correct diagnostic rate is indeed very promising. Furthermore, the equipment prognosis can be implemented in the same integrated framework.  </p>

    <title>A segmental hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM)-based diagnostics and prognostics framework and methodology</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Dong, M., &amp; He, D.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Diagnostics and prognostics are two important aspects in a condition-based maintenance (CBM) program. However, these two tasks are often separately performed. For example, data might be collected and analysed separately for diagnosis and prognosis. This practice increases the cost and reduces the efficiency of CBM and may affect the accuracy of the diagnostic and prognostic results. In this paper, a statistical modelling methodology for performing both diagnosis and prognosis in a unified framework is presented. The methodology is developed based on segmental hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs). An HSMM is a hidden Markov model (HMM) with temporal structures. Unlike HMM, an HSMM does not follow the unrealistic Markov chain assumption and therefore provides more powerful modelling and analysis capability for real problems. In addition, an HSMM allows modelling the time duration of the hidden states and therefore is capable of prognosis. To facilitate the computation in the proposed HSMM-based diagnostics and prognostics, new forward backward variables are defined and a modified forward backward algorithm is developed. The existing state duration estimation methods are inefficient because they require a huge storage and computational load. Therefore, a new approach is proposed for training HSMMs in which state duration probabilities are estimated on the lattice (or trellis) of observations and states. The model parameters are estimated through the modified forward backward training algorithm. The estimated state duration probability distributions combined with state-changing point detection can be used to predict the useful remaining life of a system. The evaluation of the proposed methodology was carried out through a real-world application: health monitoring of hydraulic pumps. In the tests, the recognition rates for all states are greater than 96%. For each individual pump, the recognition rate is increased by 29.3% in comparison with HMMs. Because of the temporal structures, the same HSMMs can be used to predict the remaining-useful-life (RUL) of the pumps.</p>

    <title>A prognosis method using age-dependent hidden semi-Markov model for equipment health prediction</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Peng, Y., &amp; Dong, M.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Health monitoring and prognostics of equipment is a basic requirement for condition-based maintenance (CBM) in many application domains. This paper presents an age-dependent hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) based prognosis method to predict equipment health. By using hazard function (h.f.), CBM is based on a failure rate which is a function of both the equipment age and the equipment conditions. The state values of the equipment condition considered in CBM, however, are limited to those stochastically increasing over time and those having non-decreasing effect on the hazard rate. The previous HSMM based prognosis algorithm assumed that the transition probabilities are only state-dependent, which means that the probability of making transition to a less healthy state does not increase with the age. In the proposed method, in order to characterize the deterioration of equipment, three types of aging factors that discount the probabilities of staying at current state while increasing the probabilities of transitions to less healthy states are integrated into the HSMM. With an iteration algorithm, the original transition matrix obtained from the HSMM can be renewed with aging factors. To predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the equipment, hazard rate is introduced to combine with the health-state transition matrix. With the classification information obtained from the HSMM, which provides the current health state of the equipment, the new RUL computation algorithm could be applied for the equipment prognostics. The performances of the HSMMs with aging factors are compared by using historical data colleted from hydraulic pumps through a case study. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Early detection of abnormalities in the motor will help avoid expensive failure. It has been shown that rotor faults such as broken rotor bars can be detected by several methods. This paper deals with the application of the spectral analysis of the instantaneous power for the detection of rotor cage faults in operating three phase induction motors. This approach carries more information than that of the current spectral analysis approach.

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Bearing failure is one of the foremost causes of breakdowns in rotating machinery and such failure can be catastrophic, resulting in costly downtime. One of the key issues in bearing prognostics is to detect the defect at its incipient stage and alert the operator before it develops into a catastrophic failure. Signal de-noising and extraction of the weak signature are crucial to bearing prognostics since the inherent deficiency of the measuring mechanism often introduces a great amount of noise to the signal. In addition, the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and hence can easily become masked by noise and low frequency effects. As a result, robust methods are needed to provide more evident information for bearing performance assessment and prognostics. This paper introduces enhanced and robust prognostic methods for rolling element bearing including a wavelet filter based method for weak signature enhancement for fault identification and Self Organizing Map (SOM) based method for performance degradation assessment. The experimental results demonstrate that the bearing defects can be detected at an early stage of development when both optimal wavelet filter and SOM method are used. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>As attention to environmental problems grows, product life cycle management is becoming a crucial issue in realizing a sustainable society. Our objective is to provide the functions necessary for such a society while minimizing material and energy consumption. From this viewpoint, we should redefine the role of maintenance as a prime method for life cycle management. In this paper, we first discuss the changing role of maintenance from the perspective of life cycle management. Then, we present a maintenance framework that shows management cycles of maintenance activities during the product life cycle. According to this framework, we identify technical issues of maintenance and discuss the advances of technologies supporting the change in the role of maintenance.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Visual analytics plays a key role in the era of connected industry (or industry 4.0, industrial internet) as modern machines and assembly lines generate large amounts of data and effective visual exploration techniques are needed for troubleshooting, process optimization, and decision making. However, developing effective visual analytics solutions for this application domain is a challenging task due to the sheer volume and the complexity of the data collected in the manufacturing processes. We report the design and implementation of a comprehensive visual analytics system, ViDX. It supports both real-time tracking of assembly line performance and historical data exploration to identify inefficiencies, locate anomalies, and form hypotheses about their causes and effects. The system is designed based on a set of requirements gathered through discussions with the managers and operators from manufacturing sites. It features interlinked views displaying data at different levels of detail. In particular, we apply and extend the Marey’s graph by introducing a time-aware outlier-preserving visual aggregation technique to support effective troubleshooting in manufacturing processes. We also introduce two novel interaction techniques, namely the quantiles brush and samples brush, for the users to interactively steer the outlier detection algorithms. We evaluate the system with example use cases and an in-depth user interview, both conducted together with the managers and operators from manufacturing plants. The result demonstrates its effectiveness and reports a successful pilot application of visual analytics for manufacturing in smart factories. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper investigates a novel two-phase preventive maintenance policy for a single-component system with an objective of maximizing the revenue generated by the performance-based contracting (PBC). The system undergoes a defective state before failure, and produces signal hinting the condition. The maintenance policy consists of two phases: imperfect maintenance phase followed by postponed replacement phase. In the imperfect maintenance phase, inspection is performed to reveal the defective state, leading to a possible repair. Both the inspection and the repair are imperfect. In the postponed replacement phase, preventive replacement is performed during the upcoming scheduled maintenance window, before which no inspection or repair is executed. The expected net revenue under PBC is maximized via the joint optimization of the inspection interval, number of inspection and preventive replacement interval. We apply the model to a case from a steel converter plant, and the results show that our proposed maintenance policy outperforms some existing maintenance policies in terms of the net revenue.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Industry 4.0 has become more popular due to recent developments in cyber-physical systems, big data,  cloud computing, and industrial wireless networks. Intelligent manufacturing has produced a revolutionary change, and evolving applications, such as product lifecycle management, are becoming a reality. In this paper, we propose and implement a manufacturing big data solution for active preventive maintenance in manufacturing environments. First, we provide the system architecture that is used for active preventive maintenance. Then, we analyze the method used for collection of manufacturing big data according to the data characteristics. Subsequently, we perform data processing in the cloud, including the cloud layer architecture, the real-time active maintenance mechanism, and the offline prediction and analysis method.

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Competing failures are extensively observed in complex industrial systems, which may result in tremendous economic losses and safety hazards. In this article, we study a system subject to two typical failure modes, degradation-based failure and sudden failure. The system is operating under a random environment where external shocks arrive according to a Poisson process. The impact of shock damage on system failure is two-fold: (a) increase the hazard rate of sudden failure; (b) cause abrupt degradation increment. The system is preventively replaced when its age attains a pre-determined threshold (age-based replacement), and undergoes a finite number of condition monitoring (CM) before this replacement. At a CM, the control limit of preventive replacement varies with the number of CM and is determined by a reliability criterion. The objective of this paper is to jointly optimize the replacement interval, monitoring interval and reliability criterion such that the expected cost per unit time is minimized. A case study on oil pipeline is provided to illustrate the applicability of the maintenance strategy.</p>

    <title>Deep reinforcement learning based preventive maintenance policy for serial production lines</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Huang, J., Chang, Q., &amp; Arinez, J.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In the manufacturing industry, the preventive maintenance (PM) is a common practice to reduce random machine failures by replacing/repairing the aged machines or parts. The decision on when and where the preventive maintenance needs to be carried out is nontrivial due to the complex and stochastic nature of a serial production line with intermediate buffers. In order to improve the cost efficiency of the serial production lines, a deep reinforcement learning based approach is proposed to obtain PM policy. A novel modeling method for the serial production line is adopted during the learning process. A reward function is proposed based on the system production loss evaluation. The algorithm based on the Double Deep Q-Network is applied to learn the PM policy. Using the simulation study, the learning algorithm is proved effective in delivering PM policy that leads to an increased throughput and reduced cost. Interestingly, the learned policy is found to frequently conduct group maintenance and opportunistic maintenance, although their concepts and rules are not provided during the learning process. This finding further demonstrates that the problem formulation, the proposed algorithm and the reward function setting in this paper are effective.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Seiti, H., &amp; Hafezalkotob, A.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The importance of day-to-day maintenance has increased because it plays a vital role in maintaining and improving the availability, product quality, safety requirements, and low costs for organizations. There are numerous ways to plan and decide on the maintenance problems, where multi-criteria decision making is one of the fundamental tools. However, in many organizations, especially where information about the likelihood of equipment failure is low, the use of quantitative models is not feasible. Furthermore, because of the dynamic nature of maintenance and the existence of unpredicted or unplanned factors of the equipment reliability, planning the tasks becomes more difficult. Hence, this paper presents a novel fuzzy model to express fuzzy reliability and takes into consideration the risk and error of taking possible influential factors. Moreover, new concepts, such as positive and negative risks, positive and negative acceptable risks, and risk-based TOPSIS methodology for preventive maintenance planning in a multi-period time horizon, have been developed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a real case study is presented for one of the strategic units in a rolling mill company. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Amiri, S., &amp; Honarvar, M.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In this paper, a bi-objective mathematical model is presented for energy hub scheduling with consideration of preventive maintenance policy. In the model, the hub equipment is assumed to be at risk of random failure, and a periodic preventive maintenance action is planned considering the energy hub utilization plan to take the system into an operational state as good as new. The aim of the proposed model is to determine the preventive maintenance cycles and the best strategy to allocate hub energy capacity under different demand scenarios, while the goals are to minimize costs and to maximize the reliability of the system. The novelty of this paper is the integration of preventive maintenance scheduling and energy hub scheduling. Considering the uncertainty of the demand, a scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming approach is used. CPLEX solver of GAMS is used to solve the model based on the Epsilon-constraint method. The sensitivity analysis is provided to define the effect of parameters such as demand and capacity on the model. The performance of the proposed integrated model is compared with the solutions offered by two well-known techniques from the subject literature. The results show that the integrated model possesses outstanding performance. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>There are many instances in which the quality of a product or constancy of a process is determined by the joint levels of several attributes or properties. During the conduct of such a process or the production of such a product, one wishes to detect as quickly as possible any departure from a satisfactory state, while at the same time identifying which attributes are responsible for the deviation. In most cases of practical interest, however, there exist correlations among the several properties of interest; this makes it advisable to monitor certain aggregate characteristics of the process, rather than observing its various components separately. When the mean vector of the quality attributes is the major concern, this aggregate monitoring function is most commonly implemented via a T 2 chart. The dependencies among attributes, however, complicate the determination of which are responsible when a deviation occurs. This paper presents an approach to help identify aberrant variables when Shewhart type multivariate control charts based on Hotelling’s T 2 are in use. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Systems commonly work under time-varying operating condition. Operating condition can influence the failure time of systems, which should be taken into account when do preventive maintenance (PM) planning. This study considers a one-component system working under time-varying operating condition, where the evolution process of the operating condition is governed by a Markov process. We assume that the failure time distribution of systems working under different operating condition can be modeled by an accelerated failure time model. A periodic PM policy is proposed to mitigate the increasing failure risk, where both imperfect maintenance (IM) and replacement are considered. The optimal combination of PM interval and number of IM actions before each replacement are determined by minimizing the long-term average cost, which is formulated based on the semi-regenerative properties of the system state. We also consider a special case where only two operating conditions exist. Numerical studies are conducted to validate the proposed maintenance policy.  </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The operation and management of Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) is of paramount importance to guarantee the sustainability of water resources. Just like any other production process, wastewater treatment process involves different costs, such as: energy, personnel, maintenance and reagents. Regarding maintenance costs, they have become an issue of great concern to many operators in the last years. Maintaining the facilities in good condition ensures the proper performance of these infrastructures and reduces the risk of failures. It should be known that equipment breakdowns imply an increase in operating costs, with a high risk of generating an environmental damage due to the malfunction or the stoppage of the process. To address this situation, preventive maintenance polices are portrayed as the best strategies to reduce equipment breakdowns and repairs. Although maintenance costs are a relevant issue for wastewater treatment plant operators, there are not many studies that assess the influence of maintenance on the efficiency of the facilities. In order to fill this gap an empirical study is proposed for a sample of wastewater treatment plants facilities.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Equipment maintenance is momentous for improving production efficiency, how to integrate maintenance into production to address uncertain problems has attracted considerable attention. This paper addresses a novel approach for integrating preventive maintenance (PM) into production planning of a complex manufacturing system based on availability and cost. The proposed approach relies on two phases: firstly, this study predicts required capacity of each machine through extreme learning machine algorithm. Based on analyzing historical data, the opportunistic periods are calculated for implementing PM tasks to have less impact on production and obtain the PM interval and duration. Secondly, this study obtains the scheduling planning and the least number of maintenance personnel through an improved ant colony optimization algorithm. Finally, the feasibility and benefits of this approach are investigated based on empirical study by using historical data from real manufacturing execution system and equipment maintenance system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach, reduce personnel number while guarantee the maintenance tasks. Therefore, the proposed approach is beneficial to improve the company s production efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>We address the problem of simultaneously scheduling trains and planning preventive maintenance time slots (PMTSs) on a general railway network. Based on network cumulative flow variables, a novel integrated mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to simultaneously optimize train routes, orders and passing times at each station, as well as work-time of preventive maintenance tasks (PMTSs). In order to provide an easy decomposition mechanism, the limited capacity of complex tracks is modelled as side constraints and a PMTS is modelled as a virtual train. A Lagrangian relaxation solution framework is proposed, in which the difficult track capacity constraints are relaxed, to decompose the original complex integrated train scheduling and PMTSs planning problem into a sequence of single train-based sub-problems. For each sub-problem, a standard label correcting algorithm is employed for finding the time-dependent least cost path on a time-space network. The resulting dual solutions can be transformed to feasible solutions through priority rules. Numerical experiments are conducted on a small artificial network and a real-world network adapted from a Chinese railway network, to evaluate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the integrated optimization model and the proposed Lagrangian relaxation solution framework. The benefits of simultaneously scheduling trains and planning PMTSs are demonstrated, compared with a commonly-used sequential scheduling method.  </p>

    <title>A cost-based integrated importance measure of system components for preventive maintenance</title>
    <url>/2017/07/19/73.A%20cost-based%20integrated%20importance%20measure%20of%20system%20components%20for%20preventive%20maintenance/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Dui, H., Si, S., &amp; Yam, R. C.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Preventive maintenance may be performed on a few selected components when a component fails. Importance measures can be used to identify the most important component that requires maintenance. However, this process involves two problems: (a) the preventive maintenance time of the selected component may be bigger than the maintenance time of the failed component; (b) the most important component may incur the highest maintenance cost. Traditional importance measures do not consider the possible effect of maintenance time and cost, which significantly affect the improvement of system reliability. Given the joint effect of component maintenance cost and time on system reliability, this study proposes a cost-based integrated importance measure (IIM) to identify the component or group of components that may be selected for preventive maintenance. The characteristics of cost-based IIM are examined to determine the relationships among failure rates, shape parameters, and the scale parameters of different components. Finally, an application to a wind turbine system is used to illustrate its usage.  </p>

    <title>Integrated control policy of production and preventive maintenance for a deteriorating manufacturing system</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Kang, K., &amp; Subramaniam, V.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper addresses the integrated control of production and preventive maintenance for a deteriorating single-machine manufacturing system. The machine is subjected to deterioration and random failures. Both corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance are performed to maintain the machine s reliability. The previous literature in this field normally assumes the periodicity of preventive maintenance and obtains only its fixed time interval for execution. Maintenance level, which represents the time and cost invested in the maintenance activity, is usually ignored in the literature. Therefore, we propose an integrated control model that considers not only the flexible time interval of preventive maintenance but also its level. The problem is then formulated as an infinite time horizon dynamic programming problem of a semi-Markov decision process. The objective is to develop the optimal control policy in terms of production rate, hedging level, maintenance rate and maintenance level such that the total production cost is minimized. The successive value iteration algorithm is applied to obtain the near optimal control policy. We compared the obtained policy with previous control policies reported in the literature through several numerical examples. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is performed to illustrate the impact of several cost parameters on the control policy and to validate the structure of this policy. This paper contributes to fill the research gaps mentioned above and provides a more practical production and preventive maintenance control model for industrial practitioners.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>With the rapid growth in wind turbine technology worldwide, the high operational and maintenance costs of wind turbines have posed a major challenge to wind power operating companies. Considering the high replacement cost, imperfect maintenance measures are employed widely once downtime failures occur. However, as the metric to describe the effect of imperfect maintenance is a non-intuitive variable, the evaluation results obtained from existing research do not conform with actual wind turbine situations. To address this issue, the virtual age factor and failure intensity update factor are expressed by intuitive variables to illustrate the imperfect maintenance effect. Additionally, we propose a failure rate function update model considering the above factors. To minimise maintenance costs while ensuring the availability of the wind turbine, we investigate a periodic dynamic imperfect preventive maintenance decision model based on the proposed failure rate function update model. We also provide a brief illustration of the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed model through optimal solution and sensitivity analyses. The results obtained from the case analysis and strategies comparison, based on actual wind turbine maintenance data, demonstrate the economic advantages of our approach. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Offshore wind farm is an emerging source of renewable energy, which has been shown to have tremendous potential in recent years. In this blooming area, a key challenge is that the preventive maintenance of offshore turbines should be scheduled reasonably to satisfy the power supply without failure. In this direction, two significant goals should be considered simultaneously as a trade-off. One is to maximise the system reliability and the other is to minimise the maintenance related cost. Thus, a non-linear multi-objective programming model is proposed including two newly defined objectives with thirteen families of constraints suitable for the preventive maintenance of offshore wind farms. In order to solve our model effectively, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, especially for the multi-objective optimisation is utilised and Pareto-optimal solutions of schedules can be obtained to offer adequate support to decision-makers. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the performances of the devised model and algorithm, and explore the relationships of the two targets with the help of a contrast model. </p>

    <title>A new model based on Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for preventive maintenance with replacement scheduling in continuous production lines</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Ozcan, S., &amp; Simsir, F.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Rails are produced in continuous production lines and most of the equipment in this line are huge. Thus, preventive maintenance in these lines is performed by replacing the parts. Since the part replacement in this kind of production lines halts production, it decreases production outputs. An effective scheduling reduces the downtime to the lowest possible levels. In this study, we propose a replacement scheduling model for a rail production line. The replacement scheduling problem is discussed for 1349 parts annually. The problem was studied for the first time in the literature both in size and in the way, it was handled. A new model is proposed integrating Bin Packing solution method into the replacement scheduling problem assuming the replacements as an item. Bottom Left (BL) Bin Packing algorithm is used to assign the replacements in two solution methods. Firstly, the classical Time-Based Replacement (TBR) method was analysed and the downtime was calculated. Secondly, the Flexible Time-Based Replacement (FTBR) method was developed integrating Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. When the results are examined for both solutions, FTBR provided a decrease of approximately 12% in downtime compared to TBR. This improvement means 21 328 tons of rail production. As a result, the proposed solution method can be easily applied for any replacement scheduling problem.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Ground transport infrastructures require in-situ monitoring to evaluate their condition and deterioration and to design appropriate preventive maintenance strategies. Current monitoring practices provide accurate and detailed spatial measurements but often lack the required temporal resolution. This is because the large scale of these infrastructures and the expensive equipments required for monitoring activities do not allow running very frequent measurement campaigns. In this paper, we present RoVi, a novel smartphone-based framework for continuous monitoring of a number of health and condition indicators for variety of ground infrastructures and assets. These indicators include railroad track geometry features such as Cant, Twist, Curvature, and Alignment for different segment lengths as well as road and bike path roughness index (i.e., an equivalent to the International Roughness Index, the so called IRI). RoVi uses an optimized processing algorithm technique on data acquired by smartphones’ inertial sensors and relies on sensing, processing power, and networking capabilities of smartphones carried by car/bike drivers and train passengers to provide real time space-time information for fine-grained monitoring of infrastructures. It utilizes the crowd sensing concept to fill in the gap between current sparse consecutive inspections. RoVi provides a reliable and accurate analytic tool for engineers and maintenance planners by offering them features and indicators they require for asset management and maintenance planning. We extract these features and indicators from noisy smartphone data utilizing adaptive signal processing techniques followed by feature calculations and geo-location visualization. Our fast data aggregation algorithm based on Delaunay triangulation updates profiles with new measurements arriving in real time from smartphones. By doing so, it tackles the notorious problem of smartphone GPS accuracy. Performance evaluation of our framework has been performed on measurements collected by smartphones and compared with the ground truth measurements collected by the highend measurement vehicles (i.e., ARAN for roads and UMF120 measurement train for railroads).</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Kesavan, P., &amp; Lee, J. H.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In this paper we propose a set of diagnostic tools that can be used for detecting and estimating the causes for performance degradation in multivariable model-based control systems. Two simple diagnostic tests are proposed, on the basis of prediction error analysis, to detect the performance degradation and bifurcate the potential causes for the degradation. These tests are useful for narrowing down the list of potential causes for performance degradation. For detailed fault estimation, we propose to use a stochastic model based on Gaussian-sum statistics. The optimal estimation for this model requires a bank of a growing number of filters and is computationally intractable. To propose a practical solution, we combine the different suboptimal approaches in the literature. The results of the diagnosis can be used for alerting the operators about the potential faults and for adapting the controllers.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Lu, B., &amp; Zhou, X.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper proposes a novel opportunistic preventive maintenance (PM) scheduling methodology for the serial-parallel multistage manufacturing systems (SP-MMSs), where PM is performed to improve both the reliability and product quality. A SP-MMS has two essential characteristics: (i) the products can go through different process routes; (ii) the deterioration of a machine will not only affect the key product characteristics (KPCs) formed at the current stage but also propagate to downstream stages and then affect the KPCs formed there. Consequently, the propagation of machine deterioration along different routes will generate multiple streams of deterioration. This phenomenon is mathematically modeled to evaluate the quality of final products. The PM scheduling is based on the modeling of total maintenance cost including minimal repair cost, quality loss and PM-related costs. Firstly, a tentative PM schedule is made for each individual machine by minimizing the corresponding total maintenance cost. Secondly, the tentative PM schedules of all machines are further adjusted to obtain the optimal PM schedule for the system by jointly considering the economic dependence and control of final product quality. A case study shows that the methodology can ensure reasonably high reliability and final product quality for the system with a low total maintenance cost. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This article presents a novel method based on a semi-Markov process approach and the z transform to calculate the optimal time interval until the preventive maintenance intervention. For this, a mathematical expression that has its origin in the evolution of the maintenance cost of a patrol boat’s propulsion engine is developed, represented mathematically by a system of difference equations. This method can be applied to all assets that are subject to wear, which are very common on industrial facilities. This mathematical expression for the preventive interval is a powerful tool for maintenance managers because this saves him from resorting to complicated mathematical methods. In addition to the proposed mathematical formula, the manager needs to know the assets failure history data and the costs of maintenance interventions. These data are usually available, making their practical application fast and easy to develop. Due to the method being analytical, it could also serve as an excellent decision support tool. It can be applied to the desired time horizon guaranteeing the obtention of the optimal interval. In many other cases, applying the model can simplify the process of obtaining the asset maintenance programme, from an economic perspective.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>A cost model for optimal reliability improvement of warranted second-hand production equipment is developed. The second-hand production equipment of age x is subjected to an upgrade action of a certain level u before it is sold with a Free Repair Warranty. We look at determining the optimal upgrade level when not performing and when performing periodic preventive maintenance (PM) during the warranty period. Two different PM strategies are considered: (a) periodic PM actions having the same efficiency level; (b) periodic multi-phase PM actions with a maintenance efficiency level which varies according to the phase. The proposed model aims at helping the dealer to find the optimal upgrade level to perform before selling the second-hand equipment, and to assess whether performing PM actions during the warranty period, according to a specific maintenance strategy, is worthwhile in terms of cost reduction. Numerical experimentations considering each PM scenario are performed in order to investigate how each PM strategy impacts the improvement level to be performed and the associated total expected cost. The obtained results showed that the expected total cost incurred by the dealer is governed by a sensitive trade-off between the warranty servicing cost and the costs associated with the reliability improvement, and with the PM performed during the warranty period. It is also found that the proposed new periodic multi-phase PM policy with an increasing maintenance efficiency level yields lower upgrade levels, inducing lower costs for the dealer </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The costs of preventive maintenance have been extensively studied by scholars across all preventive optimization model disciplines. However, one phenomenon fails to be fully studied: breakdown and breakdown maintenance costs. We set out to fill this gap in this study. This study considered the cost of equipment preventive maintenance, and the breakdown maintenance cost caused by an accidental breakdown. In order to more accurately establish the reliability model of equipment breakdown, the three-parameter Weibull distribution was applied to set up the reliability model of equipment and the differential evolution algorithm was adopted to optimize the parameters. On this basis, preventive maintenance was regarded as imperfect maintenance in the study of preventive maintenance strategies for single equipment. In consideration of the combined influence of preventive maintenance and breakdown maintenance, a maintenance strategy in which preventive maintenance times N served as the decision variable was obtained to build a mathematical model on benefit expectation of single equipment in unit time. Based on the research of single equipment, a further study was performed on the multi-equipment series system. Moreover, two strategies were given, both of which use preventive maintenance times N as the decision variable. The first strategy is to take the average cost rate of the system under long-term operation as the optimization objective, while the second strategy is to apply single component maintenance strategy in series system. In the numerical example study, a series manufacturing system composed of two devices was chosen as the research object. Interestingly, we discussed the effect of initial conditions of two-parameter DE on output results. After acquiring the optimal initialization parameters, the failure rate function was achieved by the DE to estimate the parameters of three-parameter Weibull distribution. Meanwhile, the maintenance times N was optimized according to the two strategies respectively. The best result were selected from the results of both strategies based on availability. Thus, the validity and practicability of the proposed research methods are verified. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The high maintenance costs and low reliability of automatic production line are attributed to the complexity of maintenance management. In the present study, a preventive maintenance strategy for the automatic production line was developed based on the group maintenance method. The criticality of machines in the production line was evaluated, and then the machines were classified into three groups: the most critical machines, the secondary critical machines and the general machines. The general machines were performed on the breakdown maintenance. The preventive maintenance model of the most critical machines was established with the shortest shutdown time as decision objective on basis of the Delay-time theory. The maintenance model of the secondary critical machine was established based on the considering of reliability-maintenance cost. A case study on an automotive part automatic production line was carried out to verify the proposed preventive maintenance strategy based on the production line data, and the maintenance periods of the most and secondary critical machines were gained; meanwhile, the machines all satisfied the reliability requirements during the maintenance periods. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>This paper proposes a robust possibilistic and multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming mathematical model to concurrently plan part quality inspection and Preventive Maintenance (PM) activities for a serial multi-stage production system. This system contains the deteriorating stages and faces the uncertainty about estimated cost components and demand amount. The integrated model reaches two significant decisions which are the right time and place for performing the part quality inspection and PM. These decisions are made while the model is to simultaneously optimise the implied system productivity and total cost. To measure the implied system productivity, a new piecewise utility function for the ratio of produced conforming products to input workpieces is developed. A real case study and a numerical example are explored to validate and verify the developed model. The results prove the significance and effectiveness of considering the uncertainty and conflicting practical objectives for the problem. </p>

    <title>Applications of machine learning to machine fault diagnosis A review and roadmap</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) refers to applications of machine learning theories to machine fault diagnosis. This is a promising way to release the contribution from human labor and automatically recognize the health states of machines, thus it has attracted much attention in the last two or three decades. Although IFD has achieved a considerable number of successes, a review still leaves a blank space to systematically cover the development of IFD from the cradle to the bloom, and rarely provides potential guidelines for the future development. To bridge the gap, this article presents a review and roadmap to systematically cover the development of IFD following the progress of machine learning theories and offer a future perspective. In the past, traditional machine learning theories began to weak the contribution of human labor and brought the era of artificial intelligence to machine fault diagnosis. Over the recent years, the advent of deep learning theories has reformed IFD in further releasing the artificial assistance since the 2010s, which encourages to construct an end-to-end diagnosis procedure. It means to directly bridge the relationship between the increasingly-grown monitoring data and the health states of machines. In the future, transfer learning theories attempt to use the diagnosis knowledge from one or multiple diagnosis tasks to other related ones, which prospectively overcomes the obstacles in applications of IFD to engineering scenarios. Finally, the roadmap of IFD is pictured to show potential research trends when combined with the challenges in this field.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Rotating machinery is of vital importance in the field of engineering, including aviation and navigation. Its failure will lead to severe loss to personnel safety and the stability of the equipment system. It is a long way to investigate the relevant fault diagnosis method, especially the intelligent fault diagnosis method on the basis of deep learning. In consideration of the limitations of traditional fault diagnosis approaches based on shallow layer network structure, the methods based on deep neural network (DNN) are worthy of thorough exploration. As a common DNN with special structure, deep convolutional neural network is of great concern in intelligent fault diagnosis due to its advantages in processing nonlinear problems. This review will play an emphasis on convolutional neural network (CNN). The basic structure and principle are introduced. The applications of CNN-based fault diagnosis method in rotating machinery are summarized and analyzed. Furthermore, the diagnosis performance and potential mechanism from different CNN methods are discussed. In the end, this review is highlighted on the challenges and the potential key points in research on novel intelligent fault diagnosis strategies. The corresponding analysis and discussion will provide some references and lay the foundation for the investigation in related fields.</p>

    <title>A New Convolutional Neural Network-Based Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis Method</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Fault diagnosis is vital in manufacturing system, since early detections on the emerging problem can save invaluable time and cost. With the development of smart manufacturing, the data-driven fault diagnosis becomes a hot topic. However, the traditional data-driven fault diagnosis methods rely on the features extracted by experts. The feature extraction process is an exhausted work and greatly impacts the final result. Deep learning (DL) provides an effective way to extract the features of raw data automatically. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an effective DL method. In this study, a new CNN based on LeNet-5 is proposed for fault diagnosis. Through a conversion method converting signals into two-dimensional (2-D) images, the proposed method can extract the features of the converted 2-D images and eliminate the effect of handcrafted features. The proposed method which is tested on three famous datasets, including motor bearing dataset, self-priming centrifugal pump dataset, and axial piston hydraulic pump dataset, has achieved prediction accuracy of 99.79%, 99.481%, and 100%, respectively. The results have been compared with other DL and traditional methods, including adaptive deep CNN, sparse filter, deep belief network, and support vector machine. The comparisons show that the proposed CNN-based data-driven fault diagnosis method has achieved significant improvements.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Xu, X., Cao, D., Zhou, Y., &amp; Gao, J.</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In recent years, mechanical fault diagnosis technology at home and abroad has developed rapidly, and its application has spread to various industrial fields. Due to the complex structure of rotating machinery, the ambiguity and complexity of fault characteristics and causes are common, and it is difficult to carry out fault diagnosis. Although many researches have been carried out and some research results have been obtained, the overall diagnostic level is not very high. High, which is extremely inconsistent with the status quo that is widely used in production. Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out fault diagnosis research on rotating machinery. In this paper, this paper briefly introduces the research and application of intelligent technology in equipment fault diagnosis, and gives the superiority of fuzzy neural network technology application in equipment fault diagnosis, and expounds the basics of fuzzy theory and neural network technology. Based on the principle, the advantages and disadvantages of the two in fault diagnosis are analyzed, and the necessity of combining the two is explained. Based on the previous research on the combination of fuzzy theory and neural network, a new combination method is proposed, and a fuzzy neural network model suitable for fault diagnosis is established. A fuzzy inference method based on fuzzy network is constructed, which realizes the knowledge of information through the extraction, optimization and screening of fuzzy rules. At the same time, the fuzzy neural network learning weights are transformed into case-based reasoning-based diagnostic guidance operators, which play an important role in the rapid extraction of knowledge and improve the diagnostic accuracy. The experimental results show that compared with the commonly used neural network and fuzzy theory fault diagnosis methods, this method can make up for the shortcomings of fuzzy theory and neural network alone. It has higher diagnostic accuracy and has a good application prospect in the field of rotating machinery fault diagnosis.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Detecting out-of-control status and diagnosing disturbances leading to the abnormal process operation early are crucial in minimizing product quality variations. Multivariate statistical techniques are used to develop detection methodology for abnormal process behavior and diagnosis of disturbances causing poor process performance. Principal components and discriminant analysis are applied to quantitatively describe and interpret step, ramp and random-variation disturbances. All disturbances require high-dimensional models for accurate description and cannot be discriminated by biplots. Diagnosis of simultaneous multiple faults is addressed by building quantitative measures of overlap between models of single faults and their combinations. These measures are used to identify the existence of secondary disturbances and distinguish their components. The methodology is illustrated by monitoring the Tennessee Eastman plant simulation benchmark problem subjected to different disturbances. Most of the disturbances can be diagnosed correctly, the success rate being higher for step and ramp disturbances than random-variation disturbances. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Author</strong>：Research and application of improved adaptive MOMEDA fault diagnosis method</p>
<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In a strong noise environment, vibration signals are easily submerged by noise. In recent years, many scholars have studied a large number of noise reduction methods. In 2017, Multipoint Optimal Minimum Entropy Deconvolution Adjusted (MOMEDA) is applied to the fault diagnosis of gearbox. Although MOMEDA overcomes Maximum correlation kurtosis deconvolution (MCKD) defects and it can extract continuous impulse signal, but it still has the following problems: 1) It can only extract single periodic pulse. If we want to extract the characteristics of multiple periodic pulse signals, we need to further update the algorithm; 2) In a strong noise environment, MOMEDA can also search for a fixed periodic signal, but most of the information is false component, it is easy to cause misdiagnosis, therefore, the signal needs to be preprocessed; 3) The accuracy of MOMEDA noise reduction is affected by the search interval and filter size, and McDondald did not reasonably explain them, so an adaptive selection method is needed. Considering these problems. Firstly the article preprocesses the composite fault with ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and then reconstructs the intrinsic mode function with the same time scale. Further, proposing kurtosis spectral entropy as the objective function, the grid search method is used to search the filter length of MOMEDA, and the reconstructed intrinsic mode function is further denominated by MOMEDA. Finally, the proposed method is used to search the complex fault pulse signals in strong noise environment. It proves its reliability. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>We develop a novel deep learning framework to achieve highly accurate machine fault diagnosis using transfer learning to enable and accelerate the training of deep neural network. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method is faster to train and more accurate. First, original sensor data are converted to images by conducting a Wavelet transformation to obtain time-frequency distributions. Next, a pretrained network is used to extract lower level features. The labeled time-frequency images are then used to fine-tune the higher levels of the neural network architecture. This paper creates a machine fault diagnosis pipeline and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and generalization of the pipeline on three main mechanical datasets including induction motors, gearboxes, and bearings with sizes of 6000, 9000, and 5000 time series samples, respectively. We achieve state-of-the-art results on each dataset, with most datasets showing test accuracy near 100%, and in the gearbox dataset, we achieve significant improvement from 94.8% to 99.64%. We created a repository including these datasets located at mlmechanics.ics.uci.edu.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Effective fault diagnosis of rotating machinery has always been an important issue in real industries. In the recent years, data-driven fault diagnosis methods such as neural networks have been receiving increasing attention due to their great merits of high diagnosis accuracy and easy implementation. However, it is mostly difficult to fully train a deep neural network since gradients in optimization may vanish or explode during back-propagation, which results in deterioration and noticeable variance in model performance. In fault diagnosis researches, larger data sequence of machinery vibration signal containing sufficient information is usually preferred and consequently, deep models with large capacity are generally adopted. In order to improve network training, a residual learning algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed architecture significantly improves the information flow throughout the network, which is well suited for processing machinery vibration signal with variable sequential length. Little prior expertise on fault diagnosis and signal processing is required, that facilitates industrial applications of the proposed method. Experiments on a popular rolling bearing dataset are implemented to validate the proposed method. The results of this study suggest that the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery offers a new and promising approach.  </p>

    <title>Intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery plays a significant role in the reliability and safety of modern industrial systems. The traditional fault diagnosis methods usually need manually extracting the features from raw sensor data before classifying them with pattern recognition models. This requires much professional knowledge and complex feature extraction, only to cause results in a poor flexibility of the model, which only applies to the diagnosis of a fault in particular equipment. In recent years, deep learning has developed rapidly, and great achievements have been made in image analysis, speech recognition and natural language processing. However, its application in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is still at the initial stage. In order to solve the problem of end-to-end fault diagnosis, this paper focuses on developing a convolutional neural network to learn features directly from the original vibration signals and then diagnose faults. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) 2009 gearbox challenge data and a planetary gearbox test rig. Compared with the other three traditional methods, the results show that the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-DCNN) model has higher accuracy for fixed-shaft gearbox and planetary gearbox fault diagnosis than that of the traditional diagnostic ones. </p>

    <title>Deep Decoupling Convolutional Neural Network for Intelligent Compound Fault Diagnosis</title>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Intelligent compound fault diagnosis of rotating machinery plays a crucial role for the security, high-efficiency, and reliability of modern manufacture machines, but identifying and decoupling the compound fault are still a great challenge. The traditional compound fault diagnosis methods focus on either bearing or gear fault diagnosis, where the compound fault is always regarded as an independent fault pattern in the process of fault diagnosis, and the relationship between the single fault and compound fault is not considered completely. To solve such a problem, a novel method called deep decoupling convolutional neural network is proposed for intelligent compound fault diagnosis. First, one-dimensional deep convolutional neural network is employed as the feature learning model, which can effectively learn the discriminative features from raw vibration signals. Second, multi-stack capsules are designed as the decoupling classifier to accurately identify and decouple the compound fault. Finally, the routing by agreement algorithm and the margin loss cost function are utilized to train and optimize the proposed model. The proposed method is validated by gearbox fault tests, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify and decouple the compound fault. </p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Rotating machinery is widely applied in various types of industrial applications. As a promising field for reliability of modern industrial systems, early fault diagnosis (EFD) techniques have attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. EFD is critical to provide appropriate information for taking necessary maintenance actions and thereby prevent severe failures and reduce financial losses. A massive amounts of research work has been conducted in last two decades to develop EFD techniques. This paper reviews and summarizes the research works on EFD of gears, rotors, and bearings. The main purpose of this paper is to serve as a guide map for researchers in the field of early fault diagnosis. After a brief introduction of early fault diagnosis techniques, the applications of EFD of rotating machine are reviewed in two aspects: fault frequency-based methods and artificial intelligence-based methods.

    <title>Deep Convolutional Transfer Learning Network A New Method for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Machines with Unlabeled Data</title>
    <url>/2018/07/19/99.Deep%20Convolutional%20Transfer%20Learning%20Network%20A%20New%20Method%20for%20Intelligent%20Fault%20Diagnosis%20of%20Machines%20with%20Unlabeled%20Data/</url>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>The success of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines relies on two conditions. 1) Labeled data with fault information are available. 2) The training and testing data are drawn from the same probability distribution. However, for some machines, it is difficult to obtain massive labeled data. Moreover, even though labeled data can be obtained from some machines, the intelligent fault diagnosis method trained with such labeled data possibly fails in classifying unlabeled data acquired from the other machines due to data distribution discrepancy. These problems limit the successful applications of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines with unlabeled data. As a potential tool, transfer learning adapts a model trained in a source domain to its application in a target domain. Based on transfer learning, we propose a new intelligent method named deep convolutional transfer learning network (DCTLN). DCTLN consists of two modules: condition recognition and domain adaptation. The condition recognition module is constructed by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically learn features and recognize health conditions of machines. The domain adaptation module facilitates the one-dimensional CNN to learn domain invariant features by maximizing domain recognition errors and minimizing probability distribution distance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using six transfer fault diagnosis experiments.</p>
